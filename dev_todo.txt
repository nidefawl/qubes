Netcode things:
Synchronize block IDs between client and server on connect


Performance things:

Test compressed texture formats performance
Test more compact block vertex formats (non-GL_FLOAT for vec3 pos)

Model renderer:


Launcher things:
Use better compression on files


OpenGL things:
Test performance of gl_Layer in vertex shader (https://khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_shader_viewport_layer_array.txt)


Add debug statistics (https://khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_pipeline_statistics_query.txt)
 Could also be used to verify vertices/primites count sent and actually drawn

Try         glClipControl(GL_LOWER_LEFT, GL_ZERO_TO_ONE); (https://khronos.org/registry/OpenGL/extensions/ARB/ARB_clip_control.txt)
 on SMAA to avoid texture flipping
